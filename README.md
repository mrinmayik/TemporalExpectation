# Temporal Expectation

#### This repository contains scripts associated with the Temporal Expectation project: https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.623402/abstract
In this project we attempted to replicate and extend recent findings of enhaced memory following temporally regular input during learning. Here, we used the temporal regularity manipulation from Thavabalasingam et al. (2016; *Frontiers in Psychology*) to test whether temporal regularity during encoding can improve memory for item-specific detail. 

#### Details of code
The repository contains two folders. 
- The MakeCounterbalance folder contains the scripts used to generate subject-specific trial order information for encoding and test phases, while satisfying all counterbalancing requirements.
- The AnalyseBehaviour folder contains the script used to... well, analyse behavioural data. The analyses reported in the paper are included here, along with a bunch of other analyses I tried, that didn't make their way to the paper.
